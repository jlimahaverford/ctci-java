Chapter 4 Notes:

1) Binary Tree
  - Definition/Implementation: (S, L, R) where S = Singleton Set and L/R = BinaryTree
  - Other Implementation: Array, i's children are at (2i + 1) and (2i + 2)
  - Can be Perfect/Complete/Balanced/Full/Infinite and more
2) Binary Search Tree
  - Also called "Sorted Binary Tree" or "Ordered Binary Tree"
  - Used to implement Sets, Multisets, and Associatove Arrays (Maps/Dictionaries)
  - Definition: Binary Tree where max(L) < S < min(R)
  - Has very fast Search/In-Order-Traversal
5) Depth First Search
  -
6) Breadth First Search
7) Balancing Trees
8) Red Black Trees
9) AVL Trees
10) Tries
11) Graph Traversal
12) Binary Heaps
